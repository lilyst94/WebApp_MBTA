**1. Project Overview** (~1 paragraph)

This project is a web application that helps users find the nearest MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transporation Authority) stop based on a given location. Utilizing Flask, the application allows users to input a place name or address, and through use of the Mapbox and MBTA API, it retrieves information about the closest MBTA stop and its wheelchair accessibility status. Additionally, the webpage displays real-time weather information for the specificed location, enhancing the user experience with up-to-date temperature and weather conditions.

**The Process**
I don't think anything went well at first. It took me forever getting the first part of the assignment to work. I rewrote the code probably about a half dozen times before getting it to work. Now looking back on what I have, it seems to simple, but I think there were still a lot of concepts especially surrounding APIs and dictionaries that I was shaky on. Then, when I got to Flask I originally had no idea what I was doing. I printed out the Quickstart guide and used the quadratic formula calculator we did in class as a guide as well as ChatGPT. I think in terms of scoping I should have considered partnering up with somebody to make the assignment more collaborative and to have someone to bounce ideas off. I was good about testing with this project because the majority of the time I was so unsure whether or not it was working that I ran it with every new line I added.

**Team's Work Division**
Like I said previously, the only thing I would have changed was working with a partner. Since I didn't, there was no difficulty with a divison of labor because I did it all.

**Learning** 

This project gave me a much better understanding of APIs and how they're used and how versatile & informative they are. I also learned a lot about Flask and HTML. I did not even realize before this project that we had been writing those template files in HTML, so this was a huge challenge for me. I think both the API and Flask knowledge will help me with my final project and allow me to both scour the internet for more data using APIs and visualize it better using Flask. ChatGPT was very useful especially with the second part of the project. It helped me learn a lot more about how to parse python functions through HTML and how to use and build the templates. It was also incredibly useful for all the little typos that come with writing HTML
